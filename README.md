Virtual Tourist
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

### To run:
1. Open Xcode.
2. Connect to an iOS device.
3. Click the run button or `COMMAND + R` to open on device.
